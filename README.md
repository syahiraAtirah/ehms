### What it does?
This web gives access to 3 different type of users where each user has different access to the web. Below listed the user with its modules:-
1. Administrator
      * Able to manage the fee and the user (instructors and students)
2. Lead instructor
      * Able to manage halaqah group, practice, assessment and note
3. Instructor
      * Able to assess and monitor student's progress on their practice and assessment


Note: The instructor is the generalization of lead instructor. As the result, all the use cases  under instructor are also intended for the lead instructor. Same goes with the lead instructor. The lead instructor is the generalization of administrator. So all the use cases under lead instructor actually meant for administrator as well.
